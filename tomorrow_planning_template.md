2. **Eat the Frog** - Do your most important/challenging task first
3. **Time-box everything** - Assign specific time periods to prevent tasks from expanding
4. **Build in buffers** - Add 25% more time than you think tasks will take
5. **Batch similar tasks** - Group emails, calls, or admin work together
